[29.08.22, 20:08:45] ‪+33 6 48 23 19 79‬: Hi everyone I'm Justine from Sciences Po Paris. I will study IR/political science
Thanks for the WA group 👍
On a slightly less party related topic, if anyone has a reliable private health insurance to recommend, I would be interested :))
[29.08.22, 20:09:28] ‪+33 7 82 56 84 94‬: Allianz or Acıbadem maybe ? But it can be easily expensive...
[29.08.22, 20:19:10] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: From what I've heard, it's best to purchase a private insurance from your home country especially for a stay abroad for the specific time you plan to spend in Turkey. They will also cover a transportation back to Europe in case of emergency, for example, whereas a Turkish insurance probably won't. In my case, there are German insurances that even offer special deals for students on a semester abroad, which makes it affordable in my opinion (about 160-200€ for five months in Turkey). I don't know about the situation in France though 🤷🏻‍♂️
[29.08.22, 20:19:47] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Which one are you using?
[29.08.22, 20:20:32] ‪+33 7 82 56 84 94‬: Justine, as I'm french too, Scpo Bdx recommended to me the JeuneExpat Santé
[29.08.22, 20:20:55] ‪+33 7 82 56 84 94‬: Not too pricey and very good as they said
[29.08.22, 20:21:25] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: I'll probably purchase Hanse Merkur. The insurance option is called "Young Travel", as far as I remember
[29.08.22, 20:24:24] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Thanks I was looking at the ADAC one

[29.08.22, 20:26:00] ‪+33 6 48 23 19 79‬: Thanks everyone for your kind answers:)
[29.08.22, 20:26:07] ‪+33 7 82 56 84 94‬: Exactly! Because some French assurance protect you just for 3 months or do not protect you in case of pre-existing disease
[29.08.22, 20:27:16] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Yeah, I think ADAC and Hanse Merkur are the best options. Only thing is that you've got "Selbstbehalt" in the ADAC insurance. 100€ per incident...

[29.08.22, 20:38:49] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I chose for AXA
[29.08.22, 20:40:44] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Anyone planning on entering Turkey on E visa?
[29.08.22, 20:46:24] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Germany has an agreement with Turkey regarding health insurance
[29.08.22, 20:47:06] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Our health insurance can be used in Turkey as well
[29.08.22, 20:47:18] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Same goes with France Netherlands and also some other European countries
[29.08.22, 20:47:46] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: You need to ask your health insurance to get that document which you can also use for residence permit
[29.08.22, 20:48:12] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Wow
[29.08.22, 20:48:35] ‪+33 7 82 56 84 94‬: I asked to Ameli, french insurance and it's more complicated for France, they do it just for 3 months or for employees
[29.08.22, 20:49:02] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Any Italians here? Any idea about Tessera Sanitaria being accepted in Turkey?
[29.08.22, 20:50:54] ‪+43 699 19294285‬: Also austria. I thought a lot of European countries, no?
[29.08.22, 20:51:30] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Not all
[29.08.22, 20:52:13] ‪+49 1578 9149001‬: Yes but it is complicated and only certain doctors and hospitals accept this
[29.08.22, 20:52:16] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: But you need a special document from your health insurance which proves that it van be used in Turkey
[29.08.22, 20:53:01] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Yes mine told me to collect the bills and send it to them and they’d Pay it back
[29.08.22, 20:53:15] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: (AOK)
[29.08.22, 20:55:54] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I have Aok as well and they told me to buy an additional insurance, however, their partner for foreign insurances doesn’t cover long term stays
[29.08.22, 20:56:02] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: At least that’s the case for aok nordost
[29.08.22, 20:57:20] ‪+33 6 48 23 19 79‬: I think France does not actually
But Germany for sure
[29.08.22, 20:58:11] ‪+39 331 705 5048‬: not accepted to what I know, there are not agreements, so need an insurance
[29.08.22, 20:58:35] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Aah okay
[29.08.22, 20:59:07] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ah okay mine is BaWü

[29.08.22, 21:42:05] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ja genau
[29.08.22, 21:51:13] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: What I got told from AOK Hessen is that their partner in turkey covers all health troubles that are covered also in Germany. Trouble is that some doctors can write private bills that need to be paid then..
[29.08.22, 21:52:20] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: I got told to visit doctors known to the Turkish insurance, so I’ve got some guarantee that I don’t need to pay anything extra
[29.08.22, 21:53:25] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: Maybe stupid question but are we required to have health insurance ?
[29.08.22, 21:53:46] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: Ofc it is recommended but …
[29.08.22, 21:54:36] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Basically not
[29.08.22, 21:55:31] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: For residence permit you need it
[29.08.22, 21:56:30] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: A European health insurance is a enough for that. No private extra one needed
[29.08.22, 21:57:59] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Also as a Student studying for one or two semesters y don’t get a residence permit. Y get a visa
[29.08.22, 21:58:54] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: Ideal thank you guys :)
[29.08.22, 22:02:55] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: Keep in mind that if you (god forbid) have to go to the hospital, specifically ask for an English (or the language of your country insurance) invoice/bill etc.. I had to go to the emergency a few days ago and had to pay the bill myself, I’m a Turkish citizen. Because the invoice is in Turkish, I can’t declare it in The Netherlands. 🫤
[29.08.22, 22:03:20] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: That's not true. You have to apply for a residence permit, and people from some countries additionally need a visum to even enter Turkey. Residence Permit is for a long-term stay beyond 90 days
[29.08.22, 22:03:55] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: But yeah, that's true
[29.08.22, 22:04:34] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: For me, I only have a private insurance here in Germany, so it's a special case

[29.08.22, 22:05:36] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ok so basically our European insurances are enough but we just have to ask them to give us the bill in English ?
[29.08.22, 22:05:58] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Yeah, that's what I've said
[29.08.22, 22:06:38] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Its not the regular residence permit. Its an extra one just for exchange students
[29.08.22, 22:07:43] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: I think that differs per insurance company, see your insurance’s policy. Mine covers foreign bills but have to be in English/Dutch as far as I know.
[29.08.22, 22:09:19] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: I see your point, yeah
[29.08.22, 22:09:45] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: Yes, résidence permit is required for educational periods that are longer than 90 days

[30.08.22, 02:40:02] ‪+7 906 284‑86‑86‬: You can check the visa requirements for your country here https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/apply/. The office sent us this link some time ago. But I think residence permit is a must anyway

[30.08.22, 14:41:36] ‪+49 178 5152665‬: Have you all searched through Airbnb ?
[30.08.22, 14:42:17] ‪+387 61 042 049‬: I've seen some places near the campus on AirBnb for like 10 euros a night
[30.08.22, 14:42:31] ‪+387 61 042 049‬: But I don't know if it's long term
[30.08.22, 14:42:58] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: In Airbnb they don’t provide the renting contract
[30.08.22, 14:43:15] ‪+31 6 26222731‬: I tried looking on airbnb but it was very expensive,  then i tried to go to real estate agents here in istanbul, but they tried to scam me, so i eventually just booked an erasmus house

[30.08.22, 14:55:50] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: Yeah I believe you can get a public transport boat that will go to Bogazici area
[30.08.22, 14:57:07] ‪+31 6 26222731‬: I tried it yesterday, travel takes about 1-1.5 hours so its okay

[30.08.22, 15:05:46] ‪+33 6 59 49 41 95‬: You can search on facebook groups, there are plenty of flats everyday. Search for "Erasmus Istanbul"
[30.08.22, 15:06:13] ‪+33 6 59 49 41 95‬: Also I think Kadikoy is a bit too far, idealy try to find something near the metro on the european side

I understand from locals that it’s a bit more , but the owner is a Boğaziçi graduate and he’s willing to give a contract and is not in the blacklist area that Boğaziçi mentioned, if anyone wants it and is okay with the rent, I can share the photos and video of the place
[30.08.22, 15:22:22] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Guys, you need to search for apartments on AirBnB and then deal with the landlords privately. They will easily give you lower prices if you stay for a few months. It's a good deal for both sides.
We (@31616380121, @351911886897 and me) have done it that way, and it's 325€ per month per person for a flat in Sisli. That's a fair price, I think.
[30.08.22, 15:23:20] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: 325€ for Sisli area is fair imo
[30.08.22, 15:23:58] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Isn’t kadikoy far from the campus like atleast an hour?
[30.08.22, 15:24:15] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Yeah, I think everything on the Asian side is too far

[30.08.22, 15:32:12] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: So what’s the purpose of the email if we’re not concerned?
[30.08.22, 15:32:51] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: I spoke with my landlord about that and he told me to not worry. There was a list like this last year already
[30.08.22, 15:34:34] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Also most landlords can just say u are lifing in another place…
[30.08.22, 15:34:48] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: On this list is half Istanbul lol
[30.08.22, 15:37:26] ‪+49 1512 8052411‬: Im also looking for a (shared) flat :D
[30.08.22, 16:06:13] ‪+886 912 992 511‬: My understanding is we still need a residence permit. Just that we apply for a "short-term permit" not a student one.
[30.08.22, 16:09:50] ‪+39 345 977 3885‬: It's no sense, it is already difficult to find rent. And if they cut 80% of the area. How is it possible to find a rent? They sent the email 2 weeks ago
[30.08.22, 16:10:26] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: 🥲
[30.08.22, 16:12:43] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: @393459773885 Yes exactly! It’s pretty hard now to find something. I booked an Airbnb while ago but when they sent the list I had to cancel and now I cannot find something suitable everything is either already full or hella expensive!
[30.08.22, 16:16:15] ‪+7 911 186‑54‑85‬: did any of you already made a rental contract? how it should look like?
[30.08.22, 16:17:05] ‪+90 538 522 22 59‬: There are sample contracts on  internet
[30.08.22, 16:17:42] ‪+7 911 186‑54‑85‬: I thought there is some special one for Migration Office
[30.08.22, 16:18:38] ‪+7 911 186‑54‑85‬: yes we do need residence pernod to stay here for 4 months legally 
it was like that last year but this time we need rental document too
[30.08.22, 16:21:02] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: The list of restricted areas definitely applies to us, since we will apply for the resident permit. Maybe there are ways for the landlords to trick the system, like giving a false address, but I would definitely make sure not to rent a flat in such an area. 
Although it sucks, I feel you guys. We were really lucky that our apartment is not inside these areas. 🙂
[30.08.22, 16:24:37] ‪+886 912 992 511‬: For those not in İstanbul yet, I'd even recommend booking an airbnb for the first week and then looking at flats in person. I've heard from multiple turkish friends they found their place in İstanbul just by signs on the street.
[30.08.22, 16:25:32] ‪+886 912 992 511‬: Especially if you know any turkish or have friends in İstanbul, this can be a way to see what neighborhoods you like first, and also potentially find lower rent and/or stay with locals.

[31.08.22, 15:07:33] ‪+998 90 957 98 83‬: Hi there! Is here someone from Boğaziçi? 
I have one issue regarding house rental. I got a flat from Sisli and now I have the contract the Emlakchi gave, but emlakchi said we should notarize it and translate my pasport into Turkish. To be honest I didn’t understand why and where I should do it. Can someone please explain if I have to translate my passport and go where to notarize the contract? 
And how much I should expect to spend for it?
[31.08.22, 15:09:42] ‪+90 538 522 22 59‬: Withdrawal period is after the midterms and u can withdraw from the courses
[31.08.22, 15:10:03] ‪+90 538 522 22 59‬: But ıdk how many times you can withdraw from any courses
[31.08.22, 15:10:56] ‪+90 538 522 22 59‬: University students can withdraw at most three times during bachelor

[31.08.22, 15:28:01] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: hi. they translated my passport when we went to noter to notarize the contract, since they said it is obligatory. the translation of the passport was about 350tl and notarizing the contract around 800tl
[31.08.22, 15:30:45] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: you can go to a local noter in the district you rented the flat. dont forget to check that the district is not in a black list for residence permit. (you can find this list on the website e-ikamet)
[31.08.22, 15:31:19] ‪+998 90 957 98 83‬: Thank you  for your your answer. How long does it take, like one day is enough?

[31.08.22, 15:33:20] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: yes, but all owners of the flat should come. and check twice if they wrote your name and surname correctly in the contract, because they made 4 mistakes in mine and i had to go again🤦🏼‍♀️
[31.08.22, 15:37:11] ‪+998 90 957 98 83‬: As far as I understand for residence permit yes, you should get it certified, but still I am not sure. I got the flat from sahibinden

[02.09.22, 10:24:57] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: Hey i have a Little request: me and a friend just got the rental contract for a flat we really like, but we both feel a bit unsafe signing a contract in Turkish we both don’t really understand - as we can’t say for sure if it’s just a standard contract. Would someone be so nice and agree to read through it so we can be sure? (It’s not a long one haha) - would be a big help :))
[02.09.22, 10:58:30] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: I can read and translate it for you, however I’m not familiar with rental contracts so I won’t know if there is something odd in the contract 😅
[02.09.22, 10:58:46] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: Just send it in the group we’ll take a look
[02.09.22, 10:59:44] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: We just got someone who approved it haha - but thanks anyway, I appreciate it 😌
[02.09.22, 11:00:37] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: Ah awesome, np 😊
[02.09.22, 11:10:05] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Hey @491718125000 , how long did it take to make the contract?
[02.09.22, 11:10:16] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: Not at all
[02.09.22, 11:10:21] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: They had it prepared already
[02.09.22, 11:11:50] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Aah okay, like a proper rental contract seal and sign can be done instantly?
[02.09.22, 11:22:12] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: hey, congratulation ! were did you find your flat, just by looking on the streets or by a plateform like sahibinden ?
[02.09.22, 11:36:26] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: Yeah for sure - especially if there’s  a broker involved
[02.09.22, 11:36:38] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: Yeah we found it on sahibinden :)
[02.09.22, 11:39:43] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: i love sahibinden
[02.09.22, 11:52:17] ‪+44 7900 633418‬: Hi there, I was wondering how I might go about living with a Turkish host family or finding some Turkish roommates to live with for the first couple of weeks while I look for a flat to live in with my friend Saifir? We have really struggled to find a place so will have to keep looking when we arrive, but in the mean time I think it will be really useful for me to live in a Turkish environment for a bit for some practice😊 Would appreciate any guidance as I’m not sure where to start with this. Thank you!
[02.09.22, 12:42:44] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: If you don’t find anything at all, there is a „Uygulama Otel“ in Etiler, close to the university. It’s a „practice hotel“ for trainees and some students live there. I got it recommended and made a reservation without paying anything in advance last term but I didn’t stay there since I found a flat very quick. But it’s a cheap and easy option for the beginning.
[02.09.22, 12:54:59] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: Does anyone have an idea when they’ll be posting the courses’ time slots? Just so that we avoid time conflicts when adding the courses

[02.09.22, 14:11:01] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: Hey, if you find a flat via a real estate agency, what prive do you actually pay for the real estate commission ? What is a normal price to pay ?
[02.09.22, 14:11:46] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: Like all the places we visited the broker wanted one monthly rent
[02.09.22, 14:28:20] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: My Turkish friends all said that’s very normal
[02.09.22, 14:28:33] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: It’s usually one month rent to the broker, one as a deposit and then one months rent upfront
[02.09.22, 14:28:40] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: So basically three times the rent :/

[03.09.22, 21:35:04] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: From what i ve heard so far, this is close to impossible
[03.09.22, 21:35:30] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: You mean getting a residence permit in one month is impossible? 🥲
[03.09.22, 21:35:45] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: My roommate even told me of occasions where the exchange students wouldn’t even get the residence permit until after the exchange
[03.09.22, 21:36:12] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Would absolutely not count on it, more like 2-3 months
[03.09.22, 21:36:40] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: 😑
[03.09.22, 21:36:51] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: And you really can’t leave the country in that period of time?
[03.09.22, 21:37:30] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Both the Turkish consulate and the incomings office of bu told me to stay
[03.09.22, 21:37:39] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: If I leave, l Will have to come back again on tourist visa I guess since I’m not having a EU passport.
[03.09.22, 21:38:07] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Only if you have a multiple entry visa for example
[03.09.22, 21:38:35] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: In my case I will have to come back to Milan to get my permit so that I can come back after my Erasmus

[03.09.22, 21:39:08] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: That is without residence permit
[03.09.22, 21:40:38] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Yeah so my visa right now is valid from September 16th to October 16.

[05.09.22, 12:44:00] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Yes but we have to apply for a residence permit when we are there

Could please advise an insurance company which can cover only 5 months in Turkey? If you know any :)
[06.09.22, 14:59:29] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: I got mine from ADAC(germany) for about 250 euros for 6 months😊
[06.09.22, 14:59:50] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Just go to your German insurance company and ask them for Auslandskrankenschein
[06.09.22, 15:00:23] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: I don't know if we have to do something else, but here in the group they said get Auslandskrankenschein
[06.09.22, 15:00:47] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Mine starts from 14.09 and ends 15.03.2023
[06.09.22, 15:02:14] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: That won't cover transferring you back to Germany in case you get hurt so you might want to combine it with another insurance. I will combine it with the envivas travel insurance for long term atays

[06.09.22, 15:09:07] ‪+49 1520 7035784‬: Thank you guys 😊
[06.09.22, 15:09:41] ‪+49 1520 7035784‬: I have a private one in Germany, Mawista, and they told me they only cover the EU
[06.09.22, 15:10:10] ‪+49 1520 7035784‬: I will check, thank you 😊
[06.09.22, 15:13:02] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I got an insurance from axa for 150 approx
[06.09.22, 15:13:17] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Euros?
[06.09.22, 15:13:22] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: So then you will have to get insured again. The ADAC one has a "Selbstbehalt" of 100€ per case I think. You can also check the hanse Merkur young traveler one
[06.09.22, 15:13:22] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Ye
[06.09.22, 15:13:59] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Woah,  it’s more than our annual insurance here
[06.09.22, 15:14:27] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: I just took the regular travel insurance of student that has repatriation and all coverages, hope that’ll work
[06.09.22, 15:14:28] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Not in Germany 🥲 I pay 1200€ insurance per year
[06.09.22, 15:14:32] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: And that’s among the cheapest options for germans
[06.09.22, 15:14:45] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Fuuck
[06.09.22, 15:14:59] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: That's with the student discount option

I am not able to take it because I just found another flatshare, which is why I relay the proposition.
The apartment is quite big, it has three bedrooms, a large living room and a fully equiped kitchen. The flat is  fully furnished.
If you are interested you can text to Bersu : +90 531 669 29 89
She is a very nice girl who is beginning her first year in Boğaziçi, for having talked to her many times she would be an adorable roommate :)

[08.09.22, 21:13:15] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: From the Erasmus reports I've read, it is not unusual that people completely change their Learning Agreement after they have arrived. For example, it might occur that two courses you chose are taught at the same time, so you'll have to choose. Or a course you chose isn't taught anymore etc. 
So that shouldn't be a problem, I think

[09.09.22, 00:59:22] ‪+49 1575 5849424‬: You must send a message to your Uni and to Bogazici Uni that the upload is not possible
[09.09.22, 01:00:27] ‪+49 1575 5849424‬: And you send it manuell
[09.09.22, 01:01:20] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: I just did that now, there is note in the Online Mobility website that Uni Marburg is now doing a digitalization process of the learning agreement and that we should be patient till they finish, till then we have to wait.
[09.09.22, 01:02:01] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: So no upload is possible, so I was wondering what the Uni Marburg students here did about that
[09.09.22, 01:02:20] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Alright, will send it to Boğaziçi as well manually
[09.09.22, 01:02:51] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Do we already have to send our learning agreements to bogazici uni?
[09.09.22, 01:03:01] ‪+49 1575 5849424‬: Ich hatte dasselbe Problem und habe einfach ein pdf meiner Uni und Bogazici geschickt und die haben sofort unterschrieben also schreibe einfach eine Mail

Hello beautiful people,

I'm a fourth year student in Boğaziçi. I am looking for a female flatmate for the following semester. My flat is near Levent metro station. It takes 12 minutes to walk to the station and 30 minutes to reach the campus. My flat is big and gets a lot of sunlight during the day. Common areas include the living room, laundry room, kitchen and bathroom. The room is big and furnished, there are also bed sheets and towels available.

It'll be 2 people including me, plus my cat. I usually keep it cozy and quiet in the house. I sometimes cook, do crafts and practice pole dancing (yes there is a pole in the house). If we vibe well, i'd love to be friends and spend time in and out of the house.

The price is 350€.  Utilities and housing supplies (paper products, cleaning supplies etc.) are included. Contact me if you are interested: +905012278198

[10.09.22, 17:09:55] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: Is anyone living in Esenler?
[10.09.22, 17:14:00] ‪+49 1520 7035784‬: Did you find a better option? I haven't arranged one yet as well, but was thinking about the one I sent you

[11.09.22, 17:39:53] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Yeah, but doesnt work for everyone it seems, my buddy wrote me per whatsapp cuz email didnt work

[11.09.22, 20:00:05] ‪+39 331 705 5048‬: usually it takes a while (2 weeks for me) and they ask for the student id
[11.09.22, 20:20:53] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: How much do you guys pay for your rooms/flats?  If possible with location/rooms/if you live alone or with multiple people/price :) because i dont know what an "okay" price in those areas is anymore😂

[11.09.22, 20:23:19] ‪+49 172 8658792‬: We (2students) pay 8.000 per Person in Besiktas (ist aber sehr zentral)
[11.09.22, 20:26:32] ‪+49 172 4685411‬: It really depends on where u live. I moved quite a lot the last year lol and I usually paid from 3k-5.5k in Kadiköy or Beşiktaş with 1-2 roommates

Kadiköy is less expensive also btw
[11.09.22, 20:30:12] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Hmm okay so the prices in sahibinden are normal
[11.09.22, 20:30:43] ‪+49 172 8658792‬: Hab aber komplett möbliert gemietet:) deshalb ist das bisschen teurer geworden
[11.09.22, 20:30:45] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Yes i know that, but Kadıköy-bogazici is a very long way for a day to day base
[11.09.22, 20:31:21] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Ja also unmöbliert wäre natürlich auch unpraktisch für 4 monate😅 musstet ihr n jahresvertrag machen?
[11.09.22, 20:31:21] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: i think 1 hour is normal for Istanbul distances
[11.09.22, 20:31:57] ‪+49 172 8658792‬: Ich mach 2 semester 
Hab deshalb nen Jahresvertrag:)
[11.09.22, 20:32:45] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Really? When i was there before i got to everywhere in like 30mins max normally😅
[11.09.22, 20:32:55] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Ja okay dann is super😅
[11.09.22, 20:34:17] ‪+49 172 4685411‬: Also don’t get fooled cause Beşiktaş seems closer but due to traffic you’ll always  drive 45 min min to campus or going back takes u 1 hour by bus
[11.09.22, 20:35:50] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Yeah i know that, thats why im looking for something closer to the university otherwise the 1 hour will become like 1,5h in no time
[11.09.22, 21:03:09] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: If you find something please let me know😅 My flat so far is around 1,5 h too🥲
[11.09.22, 21:04:59] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: I feel you 🥲🥲😂 i hope i will find something affordable there in person  😂
[11.09.22, 21:35:54] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: 180€ in Sisli, shared flat with two guys
[11.09.22, 21:37:14] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Thats really cheap😮 congrats on the nice deal :D
[11.09.22, 21:38:55] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Thanks, i just hope that there wont be anymore updates from the politics
[11.09.22, 21:39:09] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Do you guys know if university teachers demand students to attend to clases a lot?
[11.09.22, 21:39:19] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Like can we miss lessons?
[11.09.22, 21:45:18] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: You can miss them but the attendance is part of the grade in many classes
[11.09.22, 21:45:36] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Often it’s 10%
[11.09.22, 21:46:18] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: You can check that in the syllabus of the course
[11.09.22, 21:54:06] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Thank you :)

[11.09.22, 23:02:38] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: yes, it is numbers of slots when the course is held
[11.09.22, 23:02:48] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: u can check in the upper part of the page
[11.09.22, 23:03:15] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: Slot 1 	: 09:00 - 09:50 	Slot 2 	: 10:00 - 10:50
[11.09.22, 23:03:18] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: and so on
[11.09.22, 23:04:24] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: So basically “567” means slot 5,6 and 7? All together or separated?
[11.09.22, 23:05:55] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Depends on the day
[11.09.22, 23:06:28] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: For example on this one TThTh 567 so it is slot 5 on tuesday and slots 6-7 on thursday
[11.09.22, 23:08:21] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: Got it! Thank you @905363417713 @905382187804
[11.09.22, 23:40:06] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: @31616380121, @351911886897 and me pay 900€ per month in total for a flat in Fulya (Sisli). Good neighborhood, but a 20 minutes walk to the metro
[11.09.22, 23:41:50] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: As a German, you just enter as a tourist, no problem. So you'll receive a stamp in your passport once you've arrived at Istanbul Airport, which is equivalent to being granted a tourist visum for 90 days. Later, you simply apply for the student residence permit 😉
[11.09.22, 23:44:29] ‪+351 911 886 897‬: @4916099596260 don't forget to tell that we live better than the Queen Elizabeth

[11.09.22, 23:45:11] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: 😂😂
[11.09.22, 23:45:30] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: True, that was a bad comparison Zé
[11.09.22, 23:46:03] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: I hope no British guys in here

[12.09.22, 12:01:01] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: Hey guys do you think it would be very bad if I only attended a seminar that is spread over four days a week for one of the slots only every two weeks? Like will it affect my grade a lot if I miss 12.5% of a class?
[12.09.22, 12:07:19] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Maybe you should talk to your prof about that
[12.09.22, 13:12:01] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: if one finds a place in one of the neighbourhoods listed as ‘no’, there is no option to like register somewhere else no? (probably not just having very high hopes)

[12.09.22, 13:49:48] ‪+49 179 1228181‬: Maybe stupid question but if it says for example slots 567 can we choose one of them or do we have to attend all three?
[12.09.22, 13:51:11] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: You have to attend all of them
[12.09.22, 13:51:30] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: It's not optional the class consists of 3 hours per week for this example
[12.09.22, 13:52:06] ‪+49 179 1228181‬: Okay thank you

[12.09.22, 15:02:39] Leo: Alright thanks
[12.09.22, 15:03:47] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: If the courses don’t yet have the days/times does that mean they’re not on this semester?
[12.09.22, 15:11:55] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Not exactly
[12.09.22, 15:12:16] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: For some courses the instructor determines the hours with the students who take the course
[12.09.22, 15:23:15] ‪+31 6 21377028‬: I picked some business elective courses how do i know if they are offered in fall? Cause it doesnt state it on the site and i cant find them in the schedule
[12.09.22, 15:28:42] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: I would recommend you to always look at the price first and after you have arrived, look again. Last time I forgot it and the driver named me a price which was 20 TL more expensive
[12.09.22, 15:29:53] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: Oh I see. But how do I know if it doesn’t conflict with the courses I already have to take?

[12.09.22, 15:40:06] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: For some courses I took the instructor took all the schedules of the attending students and chose hours that causes no conflict
[12.09.22, 15:40:26] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: But I'm not sure if it applies to all so the best thing to do is contacting the prof
[12.09.22, 15:45:11] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: is the syllabus for this semester out already?

[12.09.22, 17:21:41] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: It depends on your uni I think
[12.09.22, 17:21:53] ‪+49 171 8125000‬: The uni receives the grant and is then distributing it

Hello guyss
Me and my friend found an appartment centrally located 3+1 house not far from taksim and with a Bosporus view 10 minutes walking distance from the subway 🚇 . And we are looking for a friendly roommate for the whole year to take the 3rd room of the house. We are both exchanges coming from France and will be studying in Boğaziçi University. We are open to any nationality. You can write me private to get photos and detailed information.
P-S: We are two boys

[13.09.22, 10:32:55] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: The meeting is on the 19th?
Because our buddy wrote 18th in the email
[13.09.22, 10:37:17] ‪+90 530 108 45 55‬: Yes, it is on the 19th! It was probably a typo.
[13.09.22, 10:37:42] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: Okay thanks
[13.09.22, 11:20:23] ‪+49 176 70792840‬: Hey guys,
Could someone quickly explain how far in the administration process I should be at the moment? As in Moodle, Course selection, Email and so forth.
I currently have access to my inbox, but all emails are in Turkish :), so im unsure if they contain any content (they all seem quite sketchy).
I have no idea where to find moodle or the platform the Bogazici uses for course registration etc. or even where to find the in depth description to courses and how many semester hours they are. 
As you can see, pretty lost atm. Would appreciate help :)
[13.09.22, 11:39:15] ‪+49 163 7336795‬: Is there monthly ticket for all public transport or is a ticket integrated in our student card?
[13.09.22, 11:45:20] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Afaik there is no such student ticket, thus we‘ll have to buy monthly tickets, tho we‘ll get a discount after applying for the student discount
[13.09.22, 11:45:53] ‪+90 507 618 96 03‬: This is the moodle for Boğaziçi: https://moodle.boun.edu.tr/login/login.php 

And for registration you will have to use this site: https://registration.boun.edu.tr/buis/Login.aspx
To get info about the course hours, syllabus etc you need to go to the schedule button on the top of the page. The registration opens on the 22nd and you have to login to get to the registration portal. :)
[13.09.22, 11:48:47] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: Are you sure? I thought we just get an istanbul card
[13.09.22, 11:49:20] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Nope, not sure, but i have the feeling i read this in one of the emails
[13.09.22, 11:50:45] ‪+90 507 618 96 03‬: You have to appy and get a student istanbulcard and then you can buy monthly tickets called “abonman”
[13.09.22, 11:50:48] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: i think you can get an istanbul card for students which is discounted, so every jounrey you make will be cheaper than with a normal istanbul card
[13.09.22, 11:50:55] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: alright

[13.09.22, 11:56:50] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: I got it too
[13.09.22, 11:57:00] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ok bc I didn’t get it :/
[13.09.22, 11:57:04] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: If someone has the form, would you just put it in here? Save a us from all sending the same email. Perhaps it is personalised tho idk
[13.09.22, 11:57:26] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: there is no attachment
[13.09.22, 11:58:07] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Sounds for me like you need to go to the office in person
[13.09.22, 11:58:10] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: You can apply for it after you complete registration and they generate you a number
[13.09.22, 12:02:07] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: Did you check your spam?
[13.09.22, 12:05:23] ‪+234 812 615 5679‬: Hey, sent you a message
[13.09.22, 12:06:08] ‪+33 6 59 49 41 95‬: Hey guys, do you know if there are sport clubs within the school or do we have to go outside?
[13.09.22, 12:06:57] ‪+90 546 642 12 44‬: yes there are if you wanna join a team
[13.09.22, 12:07:23] ‪+90 546 642 12 44‬: other than that you can play many sports within campus
[13.09.22, 12:07:49] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: so we can have a room anywhere now?
[13.09.22, 12:10:46] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Sounds like it, except for the blocked neighbourhoods tho
[13.09.22, 12:12:54] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: For those staying with family or friends
[13.09.22, 12:19:20] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Not only
[13.09.22, 12:19:33] ‪+33 6 59 49 41 95‬: So cool, thanks
[13.09.22, 12:22:04] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ah ok nice
[13.09.22, 12:40:27] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: I understand that the blacklist with blocked neighborhoods is still valid. The only thing changing is that we don't have to supply our rental contract as proof for the residence permit, but only have to fill out a form 😉
[13.09.22, 12:53:04] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: oh okay so is the same, still banned from some neighbourhoods just less bureaucracy to do?
[13.09.22, 13:01:39] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Many landlords were not able to provide the rental contracts, so people had to cancel their bookings
[13.09.22, 13:01:43] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Now it wouldnt be a problem
[13.09.22, 13:07:48] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Yeah, basically
[13.09.22, 13:13:21] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: Is this confirmed or can you also find it online?
[13.09.22, 13:13:44] ‪+212 622‑396593‬: Are we required to have a residence permit in order to open a bank account?
[13.09.22, 13:16:45] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Nothing confirmed, just my thought
[13.09.22, 13:26:57] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: Ah okay, well it's not really relevant untill I find a place to stay anyway 😅
[13.09.22, 13:28:58] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: If I remember correctly, there is another document for the residence permit we need to get at the International Office in person, so it doesn't matter. Plus you need to have your confirmation of arrival signed there 😉
[13.09.22, 13:29:24] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: So you can do all that stuff with one single visit at the International Office
[13.09.22, 13:31:12] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: I think you also need a tax number btw - so you need to go to the tax office. 
Also you need biometric photos
[13.09.22, 13:31:34] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: What do we need a tax number for?
[13.09.22, 13:33:33] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: Yeah makes sense
[13.09.22, 13:34:33] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: I think for the application
[13.09.22, 13:35:17] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: You just have to go to a local tax office, they have people there helping you with the forms and you need to pay a small fee - you’ll get a receipt that you paid that and I’m pretty sure you need that too
[13.09.22, 13:35:42] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: My roommate already did it - she’s going to another uni with Erasmus and they told her that’s what you need to do

[13.09.22, 16:47:29] ‪+49 1575 1203421‬: Hey guys!
if u‘re still looking for a room
we have one room available
it‘s near zorlu center
rent is 273€
just pm me or my roommate :) @31623737739
[13.09.22, 17:03:14] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Can somebody explain how I can use my phone in turkey? It needs registration? Shall I just buy a used phone?
[13.09.22, 17:05:49] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: You can use your phone with a turkish sim for up to 120 days, if you dont register it by then, the number gets blocked
[13.09.22, 17:06:11] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: For the registration you need a residence permit and need to pay a small fee
[13.09.22, 17:06:37] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Register the sim or the phone?
[13.09.22, 17:07:00] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I think the phone, you buy the sim from a turkish provider and shop anyway
[13.09.22, 17:07:32] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: So it really makes sense buying a used one
[13.09.22, 17:07:59] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I mean, the registration doesnt sound like a lot of hustle to me
[13.09.22, 17:08:41] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Residence permit will take long to get🫠
[13.09.22, 17:09:28] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Our whole stay is just a few days over 120
[13.09.22, 17:09:45] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Your stay
[13.09.22, 17:09:53] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Thanks for info

[13.09.22, 17:14:49] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: These are two different things 
1. If you don’t have a Turkish ID number, your SIM card is valid for just a couple of months (tourist SIM card). As soon as you have your residence permit you go to Turkcell/Vodafone and activate it again (last term it was 60 TL I think). If you buy the SIM card with a Turkish ID you don’t have to do anything.
2. Regardless of the SIM card, the IMEI of the phone gets blocked after 120 days. If you still want to your phone you have to register it but that costs about 2700 TL. It‘s really expensive. Some people go and buy a Turkish phone or bring another phone and give themselves hotspot. Other just register it illegally for about 300 TL. I would think about the options soon as you reach the 120 days.
[13.09.22, 17:14:54] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: @905466421244 you’re my buddy ahah
[13.09.22, 17:15:01] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: Just for your information: The "small" fee for the IMEI registration is 2.732 ₺ as of 2022. That is approximately 150 Euros to register your own phone if you don't buy a phone in Turkey that is already registered.
[13.09.22, 17:17:05] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Thank you!
[13.09.22, 17:17:48] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: You‘re welcome
[13.09.22, 17:17:58] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: This sim card thing is much complicated than I expected
[13.09.22, 17:18:24] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: What do you guys suggest is the most economic way
[13.09.22, 17:18:42] ‪+49 172 4685411‬: there are many stores that don’t charge u these fees and only take 200-300 liras. My phone got disconnected and I paid 300 and they extended it until December
[13.09.22, 17:18:48] ‪+49 1578 9149001‬: What if we leave the country in between the 120 days?
[13.09.22, 17:18:49] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Unfortunately everyone has the problem with the 120 days
[13.09.22, 17:20:25] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Ah in fall term it could be different because these 120 days start again next year. Until January it won’t be 120 days
[13.09.22, 17:20:41] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: But I am not sure about that
[13.09.22, 17:23:18] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: You get a reminder via SMS after 60 and 30 days. So I would just wait… As Volkan said you can go and let it unblock „illegally“ if the 120 days don’t start again in January. And if you don’t want to do it illegally you could do it with the hotspot.
[13.09.22, 17:24:37] ‪+33 7 69 07 68 72‬: What if we keep the SIM from our country? Is it also going to get blocked?
[13.09.22, 17:25:05] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Yes that makes no difference, it has to do with the IMEI of your phone
[13.09.22, 17:29:04] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: can i buy a second had shitty photo for less? (just whasapp and call rest i can have on the other )
[13.09.22, 17:35:39] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: yup you can do that :)
[13.09.22, 17:46:23] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: So someone told me that if you have a dual sim phone you can use the other slot. But I'm not sure
[13.09.22, 17:46:57] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: You could also bring a second phone with you now but leave it closed, put the SIM card in that one and give yourself Hotspot.
[13.09.22, 17:49:51] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Yes, that should be possible. The easiest option is E-SIM. It costs just 60 TL. But for iPhone E-SIM is just 11 or up
[13.09.22, 17:55:03] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: What exactly is an E-Sim?
[13.09.22, 17:55:28] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: It's a hardware component in some phones
[13.09.22, 17:55:34] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: So you don't need a physical sim card

[13.09.22, 17:59:52] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: And who gets that
[13.09.22, 18:00:04] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: Its basically all governmental services you can get online
[13.09.22, 18:00:18] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: its basically what germany cant do since 50 years 🥲
[13.09.22, 18:00:36] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: but I know people with mavi kart and turkish citizenships get it
[13.09.22, 18:00:43] ‪+49 173 9050563‬: dont about people with residence permits

[13.09.22, 18:01:11] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: My friend just told me that the 120 days start again in January. That was the case for her last fall term. I think we won’t have any reason to worry.
[13.09.22, 18:03:10] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: I also just asked a friend from last semester
[13.09.22, 18:03:13] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: I’ll tell you
[13.09.22, 18:03:44] ‪+90 537 522 76 60‬: That’s true
[13.09.22, 18:03:59] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ok then we don’t have to worry about that
[13.09.22, 18:06:44] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: But what if you stay the whole year? 😅😅
[13.09.22, 18:07:50] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: 100% sure ?
[13.09.22, 18:49:08] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Ok my friend just told me just before the 120 days passed he got an e sim
[13.09.22, 18:49:23] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Which added 120 days again
[13.09.22, 18:51:27] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: It costs around 5€
[13.09.22, 18:53:41] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: That’s great
[13.09.22, 19:30:32] ‪+61 421 073 377‬: Anyone in Istanbul wanna hang out tomorrow? Maybe we could take a ferry to Kadikoy

[13.09.22, 19:41:22] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Then you need to unblock it at the end of April
[13.09.22, 21:24:29] ‪+39 331 705 5048‬: I can confirm, I entered the country last October, my phone got other 120 days in January this year and it lasted till March

[15.09.22, 11:23:06] ‪+31 6 23737739‬: Zorlu
[15.09.22, 11:27:06] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Yeah i know, there was just one among the courses i‘m interested in
[15.09.22, 11:27:17] ‪+33 7 49 27 94 41‬: Please can someone tell us if we need to registrer somewhere for the ESN events
Where do we meet ect

[15.09.22, 11:29:27] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: True

[15.09.22, 11:59:57] ‪+33 6 95 39 69 01‬: Hello ! I did not recieve my bogazici email address either, I contacted them but I do not have any answer for now. Did you have any news about your moodle adress ? :)
[15.09.22, 12:00:47] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: No still not. Don’t worry! It will workout
[15.09.22, 12:02:32] ‪+33 7 50 68 96 27‬: Me neither ahah
[15.09.22, 12:57:55] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: You actually have a course planner when you log in. So you can quite easily plan you courses en check if any overlap
[15.09.22, 13:03:11] ‪+49 162 9037754‬: Is someone here from Jordan ? If yes I just have some questions with regard to some visa issues😅
[15.09.22, 13:09:27] ‪+90 531 515 97 08‬: We are in Sinanpaşa and we don't have it either
[15.09.22, 14:47:01] ‪+49 172 4685411‬: ahaha welcome to Beşiktaş where water and electricity are a luxury 😭
[15.09.22, 14:47:26] ‎‪+49 176 21015936‬ ist der Gruppe mit dem Einladungslink beigetreten.
[15.09.22, 14:51:49] ‪+33 7 50 68 96 27‬: Argh, I hope we will have it back soon 😂
[15.09.22, 14:52:32] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: For me, it doesn't show the courses from all departments for some reason. It only shows the management courses. The strange thing is that I am at the Industrial Engineering Department, not the Management Department 😂
Does anybody else have this problem?
[15.09.22, 14:59:12] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: Oh that's weird for me it shows all the courses
[15.09.22, 15:19:41] Leo: Is the selection of the courses First come first serve? So do we have to hurry with the selection once it’s open?
[15.09.22, 15:19:54] ‪+31 6 24550757‬: Hi guys, a question. Do we have to follow each course for three hours or is it sufficient to also follow a course for 1 hour?
[15.09.22, 15:20:36] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Bachelor‘s yes
[15.09.22, 15:20:50] Leo: And masters?
[15.09.22, 15:21:14] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: At least for management i was told i need to ask the profs for their consent
[15.09.22, 15:21:30] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Does anyone attend master courses in management and economics
[15.09.22, 15:21:41] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Management yes
[15.09.22, 15:21:44] Leo: Do you have to ask in advance?
[15.09.22, 15:21:54] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: Anyone masters civil engineering?
[15.09.22, 15:21:58] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I guess so, i dont really know
[15.09.22, 15:22:10] Leo: Alright thanks
[15.09.22, 16:48:52] ‪+61 411 829 885‬: how do you find living in Kadikoy?
[15.09.22, 16:54:38] ‪+61 411 829 885‬: also who else is doing their masters here? :)
[15.09.22, 16:58:09] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: I am
[15.09.22, 17:07:24] ‪+49 176 58916919‬: actually a friend of mine was already in istanbul since  beginning of september and found a place for the both of us... :)
[15.09.22, 17:48:41] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: I’d like to know this too, anyone any idea?
[15.09.22, 17:52:27] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: When a course is 3 hours all hours are different from each other for example at first hour topic 1a is done at second 1b and then 1c and the next week they keep moving on from where they left in the last hour
[15.09.22, 17:52:49] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: So just following one hour may not be a good idea
[15.09.22, 17:53:00] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Plus there can be attendance as well
[15.09.22, 17:53:51] ‪+61 411 829 885‬: Is it a nice place to live?
[15.09.22, 17:54:01] ‪+61 411 829 885‬: Im thinking about living there :)
[15.09.22, 18:05:29] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: So basically what you're saying is that we are screwed🥲 Thanks😅
[15.09.22, 18:07:03] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Well topics don't always go really fast but since the course consists of 3 hours per week every hour it continues from the last one
[15.09.22, 18:15:03] ‪+33 6 59 78 56 09‬: Same
[15.09.22, 18:44:09] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: Kadıköy is great

[15.09.22, 18:52:29] ‪+61 411 829 885‬: Does anyond know of any rooms for rent? Im looking from end of September 2022 to end of feb 2023 :)

[16.09.22, 01:27:54] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: In short: what should I do to get my monthly grant after I receive my signed learning agreement?
[16.09.22, 02:31:05] ‪+49 172 8658792‬: Das bezieht sich auf die Vorlesungszeit :)

[16.09.22, 10:08:08] ‪+1 (970) 275‑1413‬: They should be the same ones that appear on the schedule for this semester

[16.09.22, 10:11:53] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: Was just about to say 😅 thanks for correcting!
[16.09.22, 10:12:30] ‪+49 1577 2848997‬: But now you can only see which courses are offered, Right?
[16.09.22, 10:15:19] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Yes you can see the courses offered there and make a plan for your courselist
[16.09.22, 10:16:54] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: Which tool is this? Moodle?
[16.09.22, 10:16:56] ‪+31 6 21377028‬: yess
[16.09.22, 10:17:47] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I think that’s the homepage, where you can check the schedule etc
[16.09.22, 10:18:19] ‪+31 6 21377028‬: yeah when you log in and then course planner
[16.09.22, 10:18:37] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: Do you have a link?
[16.09.22, 10:19:20] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: https://registration.boun.edu.tr/buis/Login.aspx

[16.09.22, 10:32:17] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: This basically
[16.09.22, 10:34:55] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: You can already log into this page?
[16.09.22, 10:37:50] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Nope
[16.09.22, 10:37:56] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Some do, others cant
[16.09.22, 10:38:19] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: You don't need to login to check the syllabuses
[16.09.22, 10:38:32] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: I know j was just wondering
[16.09.22, 10:38:54] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: We need this page for course registration tho, dont we
[16.09.22, 10:39:03] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Yeah
[16.09.22, 10:39:10] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: 🙃
[16.09.22, 10:40:03] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: You need to have a student id, and iirc they send the new students a temporary password or sth? It's been a few years so i might be remembering wrong tho
[16.09.22, 10:40:47] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: So you can log in and make your own password
[16.09.22, 10:41:29] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Roundcube and moodle work both, however this page doesnt
[16.09.22, 10:45:13] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: You both login to them with boun email and password but for registration first you login with your home uni email as far as I know for preregistration etc
[16.09.22, 10:45:26] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: But then you login with the student number given
[16.09.22, 10:48:03] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: Yep, that's correct for me as well.

So for example for moodle and roundcube it would just be something like: Max.Mustermann

And for the page you mentioned you would need to login with something like: Max.Mustermann@hometown-uni.de

If that makes any sense to you.

The passwords are either still the ones given to you via mail or the ones that you chose by yourself.
[16.09.22, 10:58:35] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Yeah it does, and i tried that, but still got an error
[16.09.22, 10:59:29] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: Oh that sucks... 😅
[16.09.22, 11:04:31] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: There might be a system error, I'm sorry you're dealing with that 😔 it might be the best to contact with the office if it persists, maybe they can help with it
[16.09.22, 11:08:07] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Did that already, waiting for a response 👌🏼
[16.09.22, 11:09:37] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: I hope they resolve it soon🙏🏼🙏🏼
[16.09.22, 11:31:13] ‪+82 10‑7126‑2666‬: Are there anyone who already registered name in a contract of house as the proof? I am looking for the way how to do that🥲
[16.09.22, 11:58:19] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: You can also check the schedule of the previous year. For must courses there is a syllabus there 😉
[16.09.22, 12:00:20] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: You don't need the rental contract as proof for the residence permit application anymore. Bogazici sent an email regarding this a few days ago
[16.09.22, 12:02:15] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Applies only for erasmus as far as i know
[16.09.22, 12:04:18] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Oh, true
[16.09.22, 12:04:58] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: But still, you dont necessarily need a rental contract, you can also set up a doc with your landlord at a notary
[16.09.22, 12:07:25] ‪+82 10‑7126‑2666‬: I see. I visited notaty today it costs around 500lira. Its the only way to do that?
[16.09.22, 12:09:26] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I dont know of any other
[16.09.22, 12:11:37] ‪+82 10‑7126‑2666‬: Thank you :)

[16.09.22, 16:00:11] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Can we get cheap university accomodation as Erasmus Students?
[16.09.22, 16:00:38] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: The super dorm they offer is too expensive, 3000 Euros. Too much
[16.09.22, 16:00:50] ‪+49 1516 4841338‬: Crazy right

[16.09.22, 16:01:28] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: in Germany, Erasmus students stay in university accomodation and pay like 200 Euros only
[16.09.22, 16:02:01] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: For 6 months *
[16.09.22, 16:02:13] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Is this option available for us here in Turkey?
[16.09.22, 16:02:51] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Still expensive, that's like 500 Euros per month. Our grant is much less than that!
[16.09.22, 16:06:12] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Does anyone from the Turkish mentors here know if we can get accomodation provided by the university for cheaper prices that renting privately and paying commission for brokers etc? I also heard that in Turkey you never get your deposit back if you rent a place, or only get half of it.

[16.09.22, 21:13:12] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: Youre supposed to enter with your passport so you get a stamp
[16.09.22, 21:14:15] ‪+49 173 8295726‬: but is it mandatory? The problem is my passport is at my parents and I can't really get it before my flight 😅
[16.09.22, 21:14:58] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: Im pretty sure it was written somewhere that you should enter with you passport - but i dont know how important this actually is
[16.09.22, 21:18:24] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I think it’s very important
[16.09.22, 21:19:31] ‪+33 7 49 27 94 41‬: You can enter in Turkey with your european ID like as a tourist traveler. but with a student statue… Check the gov site
[16.09.22, 21:19:47] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: As far as I know you can enter with your ID but for the application process regarding the residence permit you indeed need a valid passport, the ID is not sufficient there

[16.09.22, 22:33:43] ‪+90 531 515 97 08‬: Not sure about that. But I guess it depends where you're from

[17.09.22, 10:03:34] ‪+33 7 49 27 94 41‬: Exactly, it is for most European Union citizens (like 🇩🇪 or 🇫🇷)

for me, i didnt need my home university email first, i needed the exact same email address that i used in order to fill out the pre-registration form. The email you need should be the username from the email with the following title: Erasmus / Exchange / Visitor Student applications 2022/2023 BOĞAZİÇİ UNIVERSITY
[17.09.22, 15:24:03] ‪+49 172 9774620‬: Thank you!

[17.09.22, 15:34:37] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Is this already open ?
[17.09.22, 15:36:59] ‪+32 488 25 29 43‬: I don’t have a single clue 🤡 I’m just wondering
[17.09.22, 15:37:19] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: the registration isnt, but you can organize your courses under course planer
[17.09.22, 15:37:32] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: at least you can check for overlaps and whether they are available at all
[17.09.22, 15:39:19] ‪+33 7 69 07 68 72‬: Do you know what is the maximum number of credit/courses we can take per semester? I've asked the uni but they did not answer...
[17.09.22, 15:40:16] ‪+32 488 25 29 43‬: Depends on your university I guess, as far as mine is concerned I can only take up to 25 credits
[17.09.22, 15:40:20] ‪+32 488 25 29 43‬: For example
[17.09.22, 15:40:44] ‪+32 488 25 29 43‬: And I’m only staying for a term so
[17.09.22, 16:09:52] ‪+39 345 977 3885‬: For me more than 30 Credits.
[17.09.22, 16:19:35] ‪+31 6 26222731‬: same
[17.09.22, 16:26:10] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Hahaha, in a semester abroad, most guys are rather concerned about the minimum number of ECTS they have to take 😂
[17.09.22, 16:27:21] ‪+32 488 25 29 43‬: Hahha same I chose the minimum required
[17.09.22, 16:31:40] ‪+33 7 50 68 96 27‬: Same here ahah
[17.09.22, 16:32:08] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Is there a minimum 🥲
[17.09.22, 16:33:41] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Yes, for erasmus 24 ects
[17.09.22, 16:34:06] ‪+33 7 50 68 96 27‬: Depends on your school
[17.09.22, 16:34:21] ‪+33 7 50 68 96 27‬: For me it’s 60
[17.09.22, 16:34:40] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: 60 in one term?
[17.09.22, 16:34:57] ‪+33 7 83 14 96 62‬: hahah no for 2 semesters i think
[17.09.22, 16:35:05] ‪+33 7 50 68 96 27‬: Nope for the whole year thank god 😂
[17.09.22, 16:35:15] ‪+33 7 66 12 22 41‬: 😂😂
[17.09.22, 16:49:30] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Fuckk 🥲
[17.09.22, 16:57:00] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: Do you think it's the case for every one? I thought my minimum was 15 ects
[17.09.22, 16:57:27] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: in the end you have to pass 15 credits but apply for at least 24
[17.09.22, 16:57:43] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I was specifically told that we need to pass 24 ects min
[17.09.22, 16:58:05] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: that’s weird I’m pretty sure it’s 15
[17.09.22, 16:58:18] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: but could be different for every Uni I guess?

[17.09.22, 16:59:20] ‪+33 7 69 07 68 72‬: It depends of how much credits you need in total to validate your degree (for instance it is 180 for a bachelor in my uni, if you are in the last year of your degree you have to make sure to have enough in total --> if you still need 30 even if the minimum is 15 you will need to validate more)
[17.09.22, 17:00:28] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Sounds also like a uni specific requirement, cuz i have never heard of this before
[17.09.22, 17:00:38] ‪+49 176 55121169‬: In my last Erasmus I did as a bachelors student I only had to pass 15
[17.09.22, 17:01:01] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: I need to pass 24, but they dont care about how many i transfer at all

[17.09.22, 18:45:22] ‪+34 636 11 80 04‬: About mobile phones... if I do bring 2 devices, can I get a SIM card and use it on one of them for the first 4 months and then, when that device gets blocked, use that very same SIM card on the other phone? Will this work?
[17.09.22, 18:45:30] ‪+34 636 11 80 04‬: Thaaanks
[17.09.22, 18:47:53] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: How do we actually _register_ for courses?
[17.09.22, 18:48:01] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: On the 22n
[17.09.22, 18:48:08] ‪+31 6 43258564‬: 22nd*
[17.09.22, 18:48:33] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: I think it works
[17.09.22, 18:54:50] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: The way Melissa explained earlier, i understand we don‘t need to worry at all (if u are staying for one term) as the 120 days reset in january
[17.09.22, 18:59:20] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: It should work because it’s about the IMEI of the phone not the SIM card. But you need to keep the second phone closed all the time.
[17.09.22, 18:59:36] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Yes
[17.09.22, 19:00:54] ‪+34 636 11 80 04‬: Oh! How wonderful.
[17.09.22, 19:01:41] ‪+34 636 11 80 04‬: By closed, you mean shutted down? Under no circumstance should I turn it on?
[17.09.22, 19:05:53] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: Yes because otherwise it won’t differ from your actual phone, it will somehow get a signal to the Turkish network. I don’t know how that works maybe someone can explain it.
[17.09.22, 19:12:33] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: But isn't that just in combination with using a Turkish SIM card? As far as I know you could potentially use your foreign SIM card unlimited with your phone without being blocked. But that may be very expensive 😅
[17.09.22, 19:59:56] ‪+33 7 49 27 94 41‬: Guys does somebody know if the level of finance courses is high at Boun ?

[17.09.22, 20:00:49] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: I don’t think it’s higher than French unis
[17.09.22, 20:01:01] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: i only know that we cant take courses from economics and finance, i was told they are specifically tailored for professionals from the finance sector

[17.09.22, 21:08:45] ‪+49 1573 2418465‬: No it is not about the SIM card unfortunately 
Even if you only use your foreign card it will get blocked after 4 months in a year
[17.09.22, 21:09:41] ‪+31 6 21377028‬: Huh i have a dutch sim card but i have unlimited in turkey as well will my card get blocked too?
[17.09.22, 21:10:31] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Just don't put a SIM in your second phone at all
[17.09.22, 21:10:58] ‪+33 7 69 07 68 72‬: When you say it will be blocked does it mean that we won't be able to turn it on? Or just that we won't have data anymore?
[17.09.22, 21:11:31] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Yeah, I think so, since it is about the phone, not the SIM
[17.09.22, 21:13:55] ‪+31 6 21377028‬: Huh that’s rly weird
[17.09.22, 21:14:05] ‪+49 1573 2418465‬: So with blocked I only mean your phone will not be able to receive signal
[17.09.22, 21:14:17] ‪+49 1573 2418465‬: Doesn’t matter which SIM card
[17.09.22, 21:24:46] ‪+32 471 66 53 08‬: You can buy an e-sim
[17.09.22, 21:26:35] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: I mean, I can't guarantee it but my research has given me information such as "All mobile devices purchased outside Turkey using a Turkish SIM card must be registered with the government after a period of grace." and "You'll need to provide your passport and will need to fill out a government registration form before you're able to get a local SIM card in Turkey. You'll need to pay a mobile phone registration fee of around 2,000 Lira within 120 days when using a local Turkish SIM card." with an emphasis on "local Turkish SIM card". But yeah - I never had problems regarding this with my German SIM card before, no notifications about any block happening in a certain amount of days, nothing. But I also have never used a Turkish SIM card. That's the only information I have regarding this and I am afraid nobody can really shed light into this issue since official information is really not easy to find 🙃
[17.09.22, 21:35:22] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: I'm using a Turkish SIM-card, and I also did not get any information about my phone being blocked. If you use a non-Turkish SIM-card here, your phone will nevertheless be in the Turkish mobile network, and is therefore registered. That's as far as my technical understanding of these matters goes. It's the IMEI of your phone that is registered as soon as your phone is in the Turkish network (the origin of the SIM-card does not matter, as explained above), and the 120 days start to count. Then, your phone is blocked from using Turkish network via the IMEI (again, the origin of the SIM-card does not matter). So you have no mobile connection.
[17.09.22, 21:35:35] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: At least in theory, that should happen 😂
[17.09.22, 21:38:38] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: So if you've got a second phone, bring it, but I don't think buying a second phone just for this occasion isn't worth it, since the fee is only around 2700TL (150€). And as some guys here have already said, in the last years the countdown of 120 days started again on 1st January, so we should be fine.

[17.09.22, 23:03:59] ‪+32 471 66 53 08‬: But if you have a dual sim card phone you have 2 IMEI’s so you can use the first one and when the 120days are over just change your sim card to IMEI2

[18.09.22, 01:59:16] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Too expensive, I'm staying in Şirinevler temporarily
[18.09.22, 02:00:13] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: I personally did it with Airbnb. I pay around 500 a month
[18.09.22, 02:00:37] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: If you look close to the school then yeah
[18.09.22, 02:00:42] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: Its really expensive
[18.09.22, 02:01:01] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: 500 Euros?  Our grant is much less than that
[18.09.22, 02:01:32] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: Yeah I’m paying out of my own pocket :(

[18.09.22, 12:11:32] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Did you rent it via AirBnB, or did you directly deal with the landlord?
You guys should always talk to the landlords directly and pay them privately, since you spare yourself the AirBnB fees. Also, your landlord might give you a better price since you plan to stay long-term 😉
[18.09.22, 12:12:58] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: So 500 is very expensive. From what I've heard, 300-400 is normal. I pay 300 personally
[18.09.22, 12:17:33] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: 500 is almost superdorm level lol
[18.09.22, 12:17:54] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: But please also be aware and on the lookout for fake offers.
So paying them via Airbnb gives you at least some sort of protection if it turns out to be a fake. If they insist on a payment which isn't issued via Airbnb please be careful, especially if you are still abroad and can't see the room or flat in person. Don't know how big of a problem this is in Istanbul to be honest, but better safe than sorry ✌🏻
[18.09.22, 12:31:05] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: We paid the first month via AirBnB, although it is more expensive, but to gain the customer protection granted by AirBnB. Also, that money is proof for our landlord that we are serious about meeting the apartment for such a long period of time.
The other months, we will pay him directly 👍🏻

[18.09.22, 12:37:52] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: Its close yeah. It’s like 15% more expensive

Do any of you know if using the bus 22 to get to the university everyday is okay or is it too risky with the traffic ?
[18.09.22, 14:29:32] ‪+90 507 591 91 96‬: It is very risky to use it on rush hours and it is harder to get to the campus from Bebek entrance
[18.09.22, 14:30:11] ‪+90 507 591 91 96‬: depends on where you are coming from but its mostly easier with 43R/559C
[18.09.22, 14:33:02] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: In general, Metro is the better option because it will be on time. Bus in rush hours will always take a few minutes longer
[18.09.22, 14:34:58] ‪+90 507 618 96 03‬: You can download the Moovit app for public transportation. It shows you the multiple ways you can go to somewhere with public transportation :)
[18.09.22, 14:35:11] ‪+33 7 82 18 14 47‬: Okay thank you very much, we found a place near Ortakoy musevi mezarligi, but if it’s too complicated not sure we are gonna take it
[18.09.22, 14:35:37] ‪+33 7 82 18 14 47‬: Okay nice, is it better than citymapper ?
[18.09.22, 14:37:08] ‪+90 507 591 91 96‬: i used both of them and i think  moovit is better
[18.09.22, 14:37:52] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: It goes to the bebek gate and the road from there is kinda hilly in my opinion
[18.09.22, 14:38:07] ‪+7 911 186‑54‑85‬: I agree, moovit also shows metrobus and marmaray
[18.09.22, 14:38:20] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: So it can take time to get to the main part of campus from there

[18.09.22, 18:19:47] ‪+49 178 5152665‬: It has already been written here that sometimes it takes longer to get the residence permit than the semester, does this mean that we have to wait until we have received the residence permit before leaving the country after the semester?

[18.09.22, 20:04:17] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Also me, exact same issue, but she said, it’s advisable not to leave , maybe since I’m coming on tourist visa
[18.09.22, 20:50:11] ‪+49 176 32574111‬: From my experience (as someone who doesn't need a visa if I'm only here for touristic purposes) leaving and coming back is not a problem if you haven't exceeded the 90 in 180 days. Once you overstayed 90 days it becomes a problem – meaning you get in trouble at the airport and need to pay a visa violation fee. And then of course coming back shortly afterwards becomes a problem (until you wait for another 90 days). 

Note: this is from my experience with a German passport and without any visa. For other nationalities this might be different. 

If any of you find themselves in a situation where they haven't gotten their residence permit yet but their Erasmus is over and they overstayed the 90 days: I think if you're not planning on coming back shortly after you leave, you can just go to the airport and go through the trouble of paying the fee before leaving. You might even take your documents to proof that you already applied for the residence permit, you just haven't gotten it yet.
[18.09.22, 20:53:06] ‪+49 176 32574111‬: I overstayed once while I had already applied for İkamet but they gave me an appointment months later. So I left, had to pay, came back a few days later and had to sign a paper saying that I will apply for İkamet even though I already had applied. It was annoying, but both leaving and coming back was possible. Again, no guarantee, that was more than 6 years ago

[20.09.22, 14:54:08] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Your advisor is not the person who you have to ask for consent
[20.09.22, 14:54:14] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: At least if he is not teaching the class
[20.09.22, 14:55:00] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: And what does the advisor do for us
[20.09.22, 14:55:01] ‪+49 163 7336795‬: Can you guys log in on the bogazici website?

[20.09.22, 15:20:11] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: advisors generally don't let you have a course list with 3+ overlaps
[20.09.22, 15:20:51] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: but if you convince her/him that you'll be successful, then you have a chance :d
[20.09.22, 15:20:56] ‪+49 175 7622083‬: Do you know who is our advisor? There are a few names on the website
[20.09.22, 15:21:21] ‪+90 544 131 58 63‬: Ah another question: Does anybody know if you can also send a consent request for courses where normally you would be restricted by the quota and hope you would get accepted?
[20.09.22, 15:23:52] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: yes you can
[20.09.22, 15:24:18] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: The quota restrictiond, i am not sure i understood it

[20.09.22, 15:50:39] ‪+49 176 32574111‬: I can find any confirmation on the minimum ECTS. Can anyone confirm the information that we have to take 30 ECTS? That's what they just said in the meeting. If our home Uni requires less, does Bogazici still insist on ~30 ECTS?
[20.09.22, 15:50:40] ‪+49 176 32574111‬: *can't
[20.09.22, 15:52:06] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: No it entirely depend on what your home university says
[20.09.22, 15:52:43] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: They said the average is 30 ECTS but again it depends on what your home university has decided on
[20.09.22, 15:53:24] ‪+41 79 392 60 68‬: did i understand it correctly that if in the quota info in „current“ it says 0 i can‘t apply?
[20.09.22, 15:53:26] ‪+33 6 51 49 16 90‬: When will the Fethiye trip take place ?
[20.09.22, 15:53:53] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: I think then you would have to send in a consent request
[20.09.22, 15:54:11] ‪+41 79 392 60 68‬: Okay thank you
[20.09.22, 15:54:29] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: You can check the profile picture of the announcement group
[20.09.22, 15:55:24] ‪+49 176 32574111‬: Are you sure? Our home university said "sometimes the guest university will require more".
[20.09.22, 15:56:14] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: I think then you should contact your home university to check because my said that our minimum is 24 ECTS
[20.09.22, 15:56:30] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: And that we should not take more as it could be too stressful
[20.09.22, 15:56:42] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: (But again that’s just my university)
[20.09.22, 15:57:07] ‪+34 635 78 96 82‬: Is the Turkish mandatory???
[20.09.22, 15:57:25] ‪+90 543 132 10 95‬: Can graduate students attend ESN events? Or are they only for Erasmus students?
[20.09.22, 16:00:30] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: I still didn't get my student ID, I think planing the trip to Dolmabahçe is quite early. I think I am not the only ine who still didn't get his student ID 😔
[20.09.22, 16:00:32] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Tbh, i have the feeling that it means how many students are inside already, i cant find any course where current doesnt say 0

[20.09.22, 16:13:29] ‪+39 345 938 1826‬: Is there anyone who is still looking for a place to live or has a spare room for rent in their rental? :))

[20.09.22, 16:27:24] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: So that there‘s no more free spots?
[20.09.22, 16:29:07] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: No, that means there is no one in the course currently
[20.09.22, 16:29:14] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Because the registration is not open yet
[20.09.22, 16:29:20] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Ok good, thats what i thought
[20.09.22, 16:29:28] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: The 30 you see is the quota
[20.09.22, 16:29:44] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: And 0 is the current number of students registered for the course
[20.09.22, 16:39:48] ‪+90 531 628 04 71‬: If I understood right, as I’m an undergraduate student I cannot choose courses that start with a number higher than 3 right?
[20.09.22, 16:42:26] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: You can also choose 4 ones
[20.09.22, 16:42:27] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Grads start from 5
[20.09.22, 16:49:19] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: so, when do we get the link for online residence permit?

[20.09.22, 17:15:14] ‪+90 531 639 97 42‬: As Alara already said you can also choose any course starting with 4. But I just wrote my advisor and she told me that you can also choose graduate courses under some circumstances. So if you want to attend a graduate course you should write your advisor which one and he will let you know I guess

[20.09.22, 17:23:32] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: is a course has two sections so taught by two instructors with which criteria should we choose one or the other?
[20.09.22, 17:24:08] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: Personal preference/timetable
[20.09.22, 17:25:51] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: okay and then, one course has thee hours slots, do we also have to indicate which day/hour we want to have the class? (or if it says MWW/478 means taht we have to attend all three classes?
[20.09.22, 17:28:25] ‪+90 531 639 97 42‬: you have to attend all hours since they just continue with the material
[20.09.22, 17:30:08] ‪+33 6 95 39 69 01‬: Hi !
When they talked in the presentation about "non credits" courses, does that mean they would be like "extras" for us since it does not give us any ECTS credits ?
[20.09.22, 17:35:27] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: Hey! When you go onto the course info to see the quotas etc, if it only says master, phd does that mean undergrads don’t take it or does that mean the quota for masters and phd students?
[20.09.22, 17:37:10] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: You can't take it as undergraduate, or at least you must have good reasons for consent request
[20.09.22, 17:37:34] ‪+44 7504 830948‬: Ahh okay. Thank you so much. Maybe I’ll try requesting

[21.09.22, 18:01:28] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: Hi! From which company do u reccomend buying a SIM card ??
[21.09.22, 18:01:45] ‪+90 544 153 00 74‬: I buy the Vodafone one
[21.09.22, 18:02:16] ‪+90 544 153 00 74‬: But I heard that Vodafone and Turkcell are the best and are similar
[21.09.22, 18:02:19] ‪+49 178 7048465‬: I have Turkcell and it's fine
[21.09.22, 18:03:20] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: Great! Thx! I can prob buy it straight away at the airport right?
[21.09.22, 18:04:23] ‪+49 178 7048465‬: Rica ederim. I think so, I don't know if it's more expensive there or in the city. Anyway you need your passport to purchase it
[21.09.22, 18:04:48] ‪+32 471 66 53 08‬: Don’t but it at the airport u will get scammed
[21.09.22, 18:04:54] ‪+32 471 66 53 08‬: Buy*
[21.09.22, 18:05:35] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: You think so? Its just that it feels like its gonna be easier for me then to call an uber and use data if anything goes wrong on the way home or so
[21.09.22, 18:06:31] ‪+32 471 66 53 08‬: Yeah that’s true
[21.09.22, 18:06:33] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: If you buy it go to a real store of them, yesterday I went to a tiny store and they wanted 400 TL at turkcell
[21.09.22, 18:06:46] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: Don't buy it at the airport
[21.09.22, 18:07:22] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: Per month?
[21.09.22, 18:07:47] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: No for the sim card and 15 gb for the first month I guess
[21.09.22, 18:07:50] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: No just to buy the sim card, this is a tourist sim card for 3 months
[21.09.22, 18:08:04] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: They only charge the 400tl for foreigners
[21.09.22, 18:08:29] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: So its 400tl for 3months with 15gb?
[21.09.22, 18:09:38] ‪+49 178 7048465‬: I got 20gb for the first month and for the other month you can then buy other packages. When we have residence permit the card can be activated again after the 3 month
[21.09.22, 18:09:52] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: The real price is 250 per sim card but they tend to ask for 400 when they know you're a foreigner
[21.09.22, 18:10:30] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: I spoke turkish with them.. I guess every store names another price
[21.09.22, 18:12:03] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: So before getting a residence permit i can only buy SIM cards per month? And it should cost around 400tl since im a foreigner
[21.09.22, 18:12:03] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: But they can tell youre a foreigner
[21.09.22, 18:12:05] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: ?
[21.09.22, 18:12:34] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: I've went into one and spoke obviously like a foreigner, 400. Went to the next store 50m away and spoke like a turk and they asked for 250😂
[21.09.22, 18:13:00] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: Also they will see your passport
[21.09.22, 18:13:04] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: 3 months on your passport then you can change it to your residence permit with small cost
[21.09.22, 18:13:22] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: No once you have one you can use the 15 gb and after that you can reload it with a package for example I bought 12 GB for 105 tl today

[21.09.22, 18:39:53] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: The answer is: yes 😂
[21.09.22, 19:11:06] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: i have one question about the turkish courses. all i could find are the courses 
elementary turkish for foreigners 1 
elementary turkish for foreigners 2
intermediate turkish for foreigners 1 
from turkish language and literature programme 

are these really all the courses that we can take? i can only find one time slot for each as well?
[21.09.22, 19:20:23] ‪+49 1522 8475458‬: Is it correct that elementary turkish 2 requires knowledge of A2 Turkish?
[21.09.22, 19:23:45] ‪+49 176 31777654‬: and also what does intermediate turkish 1 require?
[21.09.22, 19:24:28] ‪+49 160 3850991‬: Where could I select a Turkish course because on the schedule Planer list only my department’s courses are visible
[21.09.22, 19:24:55] ‪+49 1522 5661047‬: You can check the syllabus and check, whether you are on this level already
[21.09.22, 19:25:03] ‪+49 172 4685411‬: The requirements don’t mean anything, if u think your level is sufficient just go to that class. They’re just there for the curriculum but no teacher asks your level

[21.09.22, 23:29:37] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: I guess it’s from the video
[21.09.22, 23:30:02] ‪+49 1511 2909596‬: Aaah that makes sense haha
[21.09.22, 23:30:02] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: You send consent and if it's approved you can quick add it
[21.09.22, 23:30:09] ‪+33 6 08 89 60 15‬: Where do We see the last name restrictions ?
[21.09.22, 23:30:13] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Same doubts, should we add them using quick add and then go back and send consent?
[21.09.22, 23:30:19] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: But be careful guys the consent you get is valid for 24 hours
[21.09.22, 23:30:57] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: When you get approval tomorrow 15:00 for example you need to add by friday 15:00
[21.09.22, 23:31:00] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: we received it where? how i know if i had a consent? (keep refreshing the page? email?)
[21.09.22, 23:31:02] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Or it cancels automatically
[21.09.22, 23:31:23] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: An email is sent or on the consent request page it appears as approved
[21.09.22, 23:31:46] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: On the info part if there is any
[21.09.22, 23:31:53] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Some courses don't have it
[21.09.22, 23:32:00] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: So firstly we’ve to do courses that don’t have consent requirement, and then go raise the consent request?
[21.09.22, 23:32:15] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Yes
[21.09.22, 23:32:22] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Ah okay
[21.09.22, 23:32:26] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: And for the consent ones that's the opposite
[21.09.22, 23:32:33] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: You send consent first
[21.09.22, 23:32:39] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: After it's approved you quick add it
[21.09.22, 23:33:21] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Yep. Got it, so we should make sure to add the ones without consent as those are the time critical ?
[21.09.22, 23:33:37] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Exactly
[21.09.22, 23:34:36] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Thanks a lot

[21.09.22, 23:46:17] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: Right I will be on the lookout for that

[21.09.22, 23:53:02] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Aaah thanks
[21.09.22, 23:53:26] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Does this mean that consent is only needed if you are not from industrial engineering department?
[21.09.22, 23:54:22] ‪+31 6 22335620‬: Yes
[21.09.22, 23:55:10] ‪+31 6 21377028‬: Does this mean you can still send consent if it states that you have to be from another department?
[21.09.22, 23:58:50] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: You can, but they mostly decline your consent request if they specified a section for a certain department only
[22.09.22, 00:00:04] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: we send for approval once we have an answer for all consent requests right?
[22.09.22, 00:02:26] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Yes you send it to approval after you think it is complete

[22.09.22, 00:13:03] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Yeah, i mean if you really convince the prof via consent you may take it but it's a slim chance. mostly they outright reject you saying "this is only for [insert department] students"
[22.09.22, 00:13:50] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Once they approve, you have to add it to your schedule, it doesn't automatically add
[22.09.22, 00:14:02] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Then send it to approval
[22.09.22, 00:14:19] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: but is says department “all” so is open to everyone no?
[22.09.22, 00:16:05] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Apart from the departments notification above, yeah
[22.09.22, 00:16:17] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: we can change some courses in the first two week of class right? (or i got it all wrong)
[22.09.22, 00:16:51] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: question: quota 30 means 30 students?
[22.09.22, 00:16:52] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: There's an add-drop period where the class scheduling will reopen, you can change classes then
[22.09.22, 00:16:58] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Yeah
[22.09.22, 00:17:30] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: thanks 🙏

[22.09.22, 00:23:57] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: what are class quotas exactly?
[22.09.22, 00:24:34] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Max number of students who can take the class

[22.09.22, 00:25:04] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: i mean the box in the bottom?
[22.09.22, 00:27:15] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: 0 quota???? what's that 😭😭😭
[22.09.22, 00:27:30] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Okay so, maybe they're not allowing 3rd and 4th grades?
[22.09.22, 00:28:05] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: what does the 3 and 4 below "class" mean?
[22.09.22, 00:28:30] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Grade
[22.09.22, 00:29:11] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: 3rd and 4th grades
[22.09.22, 00:29:15] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: okok
[22.09.22, 00:30:07] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Both grade and class is translated as sınıf in turkish so i guess that is what's causing the confusion in here 😅
[22.09.22, 00:30:27] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: and how do we send documents to profs who require them for consent?
[22.09.22, 00:30:52] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: email is the best bet
[22.09.22, 00:31:23] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: so do i mention in the consent request that im also sending them an email?
[22.09.22, 00:31:36] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: bc its not possible to attach documents to consent requests right?
[22.09.22, 00:33:22] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Yup
[22.09.22, 00:33:56] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: does it say in the quota if you need an extra document?
[22.09.22, 00:34:35] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: oki ty
[22.09.22, 00:34:58] ‪+90 553 773 28 50‬: no i saw it on the department website below the course description
[22.09.22, 00:35:45] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: so we should check that as well not only what says under quota? oh my
[22.09.22, 00:36:18] ‪+90 553 842 25 90‬: Also i suggest checking course syllabuses as well if they're available
[22.09.22, 00:38:17] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: just to know, extra document would for example be?
[22.09.22, 00:46:47] ‪+39 329 717 7390‬: Is the website working for you guys?

[22.09.22, 09:31:19] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: But it would be hard to follow in my opinion

[22.09.22, 09:46:29] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: But are we forced by bogazici to take 30 ects or it's just your home university that requires it

[22.09.22, 09:49:05] ‪+49 1522 4533667‬: Its not about what you get approved by home Uni. U signed a LA, so make u sure get enough ETCs. If u don’t get in touch with yr Erasmus Büro u need to pay the grant agreement back
[22.09.22, 09:49:10] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Happens sometimes
[22.09.22, 09:49:13] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Just make sure it is approved by your home university or else you might lose your grant

[22.09.22, 11:21:22] Efe Istanbul Erasmus: Has anyone gotten “declined”? what does that look like?
[22.09.22, 11:21:23] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: Just wait for the consent requests of the courses you really like to attend. If you requested courses as an alternative plan for example but you were given consent to attend your initial choice of courses you can just add them via quick add to your course list preparation (after you received consent) and then send to approval by your advisor. I guess after you've sent your course list to your advisor you cannot make further changes until it is either rejected or accepted. In the latter you need to make changes during add/drop period. Please correct me if I'm wrong though.
[22.09.22, 11:22:23] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Also if I remember correctly consent is only valid for 24 hours so make sure to check it regularly
[22.09.22, 11:22:27] ‪+90 553 236 00 09‬: There will be a red color in the consent status

[22.09.22, 14:21:14] ‪+33 6 67 66 04 09‬: What is counted is the active consent
[22.09.22, 14:21:45] ‪+33 6 67 66 04 09‬: Even the rejected consent is not counted in the 10
[22.09.22, 14:24:44] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: If someone has the same technical issue call the ones of this list

[22.09.22, 14:50:08] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: I have a problem in registering some courses, because they are from different department, however they are related to my economics Major. Any solution? @Turkish international office students 😁
[22.09.22, 14:51:15] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: I sent an Email to my supervisor but still didn't answer
[22.09.22, 14:58:47] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: You need to send a consent request. You should write that it is compulsory for you and you will have problems if you can’t take it. 
But they can still reject you…
The last option would be to ask your advisor for help or go to the class the first week and kindly ask the instructor for approval so that you can add it during the add/drop period
[22.09.22, 15:04:47] ‪+49 179 4298905‬: Thanks a lot 😘👍🏽
[22.09.22, 15:08:36] ‪+90 531 628 04 71‬: Once the request is approved  do we have to add it immediately or our spot is booked for 24h?
[22.09.22, 15:10:05] ‪+90 545 485 58 33‬: booked for 24hrs
[22.09.22, 15:10:30] ‪+49 1525 2037014‬: It’s booked for 24h but I would approve it directly, you can delete it anyways
[22.09.22, 15:11:36] ‪+49 1578 5836576‬: Anyone found courses without restrictions on Thursday or Friday ? Without having pre knowledge ?
[22.09.22, 15:16:13] ‪+90 531 628 04 71‬: Thank you very much :)

[23.09.22, 09:30:53] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: if you get rejected (but technically the class is not full) you think email the professors is a chance.?
[23.09.22, 09:30:56] ‪+49 1575 3685393‬: what if they don't anwer to the consent request after 24 h?
[23.09.22, 09:32:19] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: The whole process continues until the 26th I think
[23.09.22, 09:32:23] ‪+90 538 522 22 59‬: They never might not answer 😔
[23.09.22, 09:32:44] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: In the orientation they told us the full time frame
[23.09.22, 09:32:52] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: You can look it up in the PDF files
[23.09.22, 09:33:25] ‪+90 538 522 22 59‬: Yes but u need to state that u have to take course, compulsary issues are effective

[23.09.22, 09:34:21] ‪+49 1577 2848997‬: Should we write again an private Message?

[23.09.22, 09:42:10] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: there is also chance to add in add-drop period
[23.09.22, 09:42:27] ‪+90 536 341 77 13‬: the system is fucked up, but it is how it is😔
[23.09.22, 09:43:37] ‪+33 7 69 07 68 72‬: A turkish friend of mine told me that very few ppl drop and so you only have a chance to get a new class if you know those dropping in order to take the course at the moment they drop it
[23.09.22, 09:47:00] ‪+961 78 986 368‬: Anyone applying for tennis? Still didn’t get a thing for the consent
[23.09.22, 09:54:57] ‪+49 1522 8475458‬: Would anyone like to play basketball at the outdoor court on south campus this afternoon?😄

[23.09.22, 10:32:15] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: hey, I am wondering, we are limited to 10 requests, but if a request is cancel or rejected, does it means we have one more ?
[23.09.22, 10:32:44] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Try
[23.09.22, 10:32:55] ‪+90 546 642 12 44‬: Yes
[23.09.22, 10:33:25] ‪+90 546 642 12 44‬: Sometimes system might allow you to send more 10 requests
[23.09.22, 10:33:36] ‪+90 546 642 12 44‬: You may wanna shoot your shot
[23.09.22, 10:33:36] ‪+49 178 7048465‬: Which time?

[23.09.22, 10:54:59] ‪+49 176 56816726‬: Not sure, I hope so, unfortunately there were only beginner courses right?
[23.09.22, 10:57:00] ‪+49 176 34541015‬: Is it possible to reply to a rejection of consent request?
[23.09.22, 10:57:15] ‪+49 176 34541015‬: or just send a new one with new message?
[23.09.22, 10:58:05] ‪+961 78 986 368‬: My request got rejected yesterday so I sent the instructor an email asking if she can reconsider or let me know the reason, she told me that it needs a prerequisite and asked for the syllabus of a previous course that I taken close to the prerequisite, and today she told me to send the consent request again
[23.09.22, 10:58:19] ‪+49 176 17750412‬: How do we register for the Clubs in Boğaziçi? For example Sports committee

[23.09.22, 11:01:30] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Bc I tried and always got error for all of the sports classes
[23.09.22, 11:02:09] ‪+961 78 986 368‬: If you want to register in sports classes you need to send consent requests

[23.09.22, 18:20:09] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: Anyone else received a message via OKİBAS system from Nimet Elif Uluğ telling you to change courses from TKF111.01 to TKF111.02 since apparently she just let too many students in on the first course, overcrowding it and now creating a second course?
I just did as she asked, dropped out of TKF111.01 and send her a request for TKF111.02 with the reasoning that she asked to do so and she keeps rejecting my requests, leaving me now with no language course at all 🤡
[23.09.22, 18:21:36] ‪+49 1578 5836576‬: There was a change section button…
[23.09.22, 18:27:15] ‪+90 546 204 46 21‬: 1-0 for Prof. Elif
[23.09.22, 18:28:22] ‪+44 7458 671650‬: Yeah but clicking on the button it says you need a consent request and I got  rejected for 02 even though I was once approved for 01
[23.09.22, 18:30:19] ‪+90 534 926 52 01‬: Same here. Although I was able to get back into TKF11.01. 
Maybe try to talk to her in person during the add/drop period. I will do the same to change to the 02 one
[23.09.22, 18:33:37] ‪+90 535 973 19 87‬: yes! you can contact me
[23.09.22, 18:50:40] ‪+49 1522 8475458‬: I'm also curious
[23.09.22, 18:56:47] ‪+49 1578 2551665‬: Just like Shuntaro said you couldn't just change sections by yourself due to the need of consent and you also couldn't just stay in the first course and wait for consent because the system automatically rejects your consent request for another section if you're still enrolled in one.
[23.09.22, 18:59:25] ‪+90 533 388 22 49‬: we’re gonna do some pre drinking before the party here if anybody is interested:)

[24.09.22, 15:57:34] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: thanks !
[24.09.22, 16:00:39] ‪+90 538 218 78 04‬: Not always
[24.09.22, 16:01:21] ‪+90 534 742 53 70‬: hey guys ! I have been rejected from all of my consent request and I am an erasmus student, I need validate 30 credit this semester and 12 from my major but right now I only have 15 credits and 11 from my majors, do you know how can I do, ? do I have to contact my advisor or ?
[24.09.22, 16:02:25] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: Uhm when you click on the course planner where you can fill in the codes and add
[24.09.22, 16:02:31] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: You will see your advisor
[24.09.22, 16:02:34] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: On the top
[24.09.22, 16:02:46] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: Click on it and you will get a mail address
[24.09.22, 16:02:48] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: Adres
[24.09.22, 16:02:56] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: I have the same issue
[24.09.22, 16:02:59] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: Advisor doesn’t help
[24.09.22, 16:03:04] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: I asked him he said he can’t help
[24.09.22, 16:03:07] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: 🥲
[24.09.22, 16:03:19] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: I mailed mine just now and she said that she will look into it
[24.09.22, 16:03:30] ‪+31 6 80080063‬: I hope I can get something out of it 🥲
[24.09.22, 16:04:10] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: At least that’s what Cenk said
[24.09.22, 16:04:18] ‪+49 176 57870722‬: He’s the advisor for management department I think
[24.09.22, 16:05:03] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: Certain courses have certain prerequisites (like a previous course at BU that you needed to take) and professors can’t transcripts for exchange students so they don’t know if you have taken a course similar to which was needed at BU and might reject you based on that
[24.09.22, 16:05:53] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: If it’s a course from the same department as yours I would check again if the course you wanted has a prerequisite, check if you have had a similar course at your home university, and then email the professor and tell them that
[24.09.22, 16:07:04] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: And if that doesn’t work consult your advisor as was said before
[24.09.22, 16:17:40] ‪+351 926 883 705‬: Anyone want to go for a coffee soon?
[24.09.22, 16:31:19] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: is it what you have written on yout application ? Did it work ?
[24.09.22, 16:32:17] ‪+90 552 730 56 90‬: I did it last year, but yes it is that one
[24.09.22, 16:33:12] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: but your subscription was in Securance Sigorta ?
[24.09.22, 16:33:25] ‪+90 552 730 56 90‬: Yes
[24.09.22, 16:34:30] ‪+33 7 81 55 01 07‬: ok thanks
[24.09.22, 16:41:46] ‪+90 534 742 53 70‬: do you know how do I find the email of professor, cuz I don't know which names goes in front of the email address
[24.09.22, 16:41:53] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Hey did you receive the slides from the presentation about the course selection?
[24.09.22, 16:42:13] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Because I can't find when is the deadline to send the full schedule
[24.09.22, 16:42:28] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: 26th midnight
[24.09.22, 16:42:51] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: Its in the same email as the other orientation slides
[24.09.22, 16:43:15] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: You can Google the name in the schedule or sometimes it's in the syllabus

[24.09.22, 16:48:22] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: They say you need it for the student transportation card. But the orientation guide did not mention

[24.09.22, 16:48:31] ‪+49 172 4685411‬: You get only one once the registration is over
[24.09.22, 16:49:24] ‪+44 7398 339570‬: Oh okay. So it is not possible to get the public transport ticket before registration finished?
[24.09.22, 16:49:49] ‪+90 505 570 25 80‬: No
[24.09.22, 16:53:18] ‪+49 1573 9341860‬: Yep exactly, try to google it or worst case go to your departments webpage and manually search for it by going through the faculty members/staff list
[24.09.22, 16:55:03] ‪+34 633 58 33 83‬: Thank you:)
[24.09.22, 16:57:34] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: Hello everyone, are there other ways to join sports/arts clubs than through the enrolment system? Are there clubs/activities?
[24.09.22, 17:01:44] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: yess, there are so many student clubs in Bogazici. Cinema, photography, diving and so on. You can join those clubs by going to their stands in South Campus during orientation days.
[24.09.22, 17:02:03] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: when are orientation days?
[24.09.22, 17:02:28] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: So we don’t need to enrol for an “official” class now during registration?
[24.09.22, 17:04:28] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: September 26-27th
[24.09.22, 17:04:52] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: nope, student clubs have nothing to do with classes
[24.09.22, 17:06:31] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: There is a participation fee to join the clubs. Last year, it was at most 40 liras. But I guess it'll also be affected by the inflation.
[24.09.22, 17:07:04] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: I'm not an economics expert :d but my prediction is that it'll be around 50-60
[24.09.22, 17:08:42] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: Thanks for all your advice !
[24.09.22, 17:09:08] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: Which is usually better for things like yoga, self-defence. Should I try a club or join the classes,
[24.09.22, 17:10:35] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: I've never heard of a student club giving self-defence course
[24.09.22, 17:11:37] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: I guess taking a class from school would be more professional/beneficial
[24.09.22, 17:12:05] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: my friends who used to take yoga courses were very satisfied with the course
[24.09.22, 17:13:38] ‪+90 536 050 83 09‬: off the record, I heard that self-defence course is a bit painful :d
[24.09.22, 17:15:09] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: In my own 9 year experience of self-defense I can say that all martial arts coaches are sadists
[24.09.22, 17:16:01] ‪+39 327 202 0657‬: do history courses in general take attendance??
[24.09.22, 17:18:25] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: Hahah thank you both for your advice
[24.09.22, 17:19:00] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: I’m an exchange student so I can’t say for sure, but from the syllabi I have read participation is always important
[24.09.22, 17:19:25] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: Usually it says if you attend fewer than 2/3 of classes without excuse you will fail
[24.09.22, 17:19:36] ‪+44 7748 668417‬: I don’t know if this is enforced
[24.09.22, 17:22:35] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: Depends what you're doing. Most martial arts/self defense courses don't have sparring so you're good.
If you go for boxing, kickboxing, wrestling tho... enjoy 😁
[24.09.22, 17:29:13] ‪+33 6 08 89 60 15‬: The self defense course at bogazici are all self defense ? Or behind some there is martial arts ?

[24.09.22, 18:15:16] ‪+212 642‑092195‬: What’s the course code?
[24.09.22, 18:18:03] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: Not afaik, as I've mentioned I don't mind starting some sort of club (I've coached boxing before) if some people are interested
[24.09.22, 18:18:38] ‪+33 7 69 03 93 69‬: The self defense course has martial arts like taekwando and aikido I think... personally I'm not a big fan of them 😅

[25.09.22, 00:37:06] ‪+31 6 16380121‬: we are going to the princes’ islands tomorrow, apparently it’s very beautiful and the ferry is cheap. Who wants join?
[25.09.22, 01:14:29] ‪+31 6 16380121‬: We are going to take the Ferry at 10:45. The place the ferry leaves from is called Karakoy Turyol (you can also take a ferry which is leaving from somewhere else if it is more suitable from your house. The ferry takes about an hour to the first island so we’ll be at the first princes’ island at like 11:45. Maybe if the weather is good we can swim too at beach ;)
[25.09.22, 01:15:17] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: I'd recommend going to the last islands Heybeliada or Büyükada
[25.09.22, 01:15:53] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: the first island is Kınalıada and it kinda sucks compared to the others
[25.09.22, 01:16:02] ‪+31 6 16380121‬: Oke good tip
[25.09.22, 01:16:28] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: these two have better history and clearer waters and they're bigger
[25.09.22, 01:17:57] ‪+31 6 16380121‬: Is it a different ferry? Or is it like the same ferry going to the first island and then you take another one to go to Büyükada?
[25.09.22, 01:18:00] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: Büyükada you can rent a bike and pedal around the island, it's really quite pleasant
[25.09.22, 01:18:12] ‪+31 6 16380121‬: Yes we’ll do that, sounds good
[25.09.22, 01:18:29] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: On Büyükada at the top there's also an abandoned Greek orphanage that's cool and spooky
[25.09.22, 01:18:39] ‪+351 911 886 897‬: Sounds lovely
[25.09.22, 01:19:03] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: The ferry will say "Adalar" which is the name of the town on Büyükada
[25.09.22, 01:20:45] ‪+31 6 16380121‬: ok good stuff
[25.09.22, 01:23:08] ‪+1 (703) 991‑3305‬: Ferry: 
Eminönü 10:40
Karaköy 10:45

I know that there are these special "tourist" SIM cards that are also available at the airports but I have read that they are only valid for a month.
Does that mean buying a new one each month or is there a possibility to get one and just top it with some data package each month?
If so, are any documents needed to get such a SIM card?
And where did you get yours (if you got one)?

[29.09.22, 13:08:29] ‪+90 505 570 25 80‬: Little instruction for the people who have to go to the SGK with their health insurance:
-get to the guard and tell him (or in my case show him a translation) that you want to register your health insurance
-he‘ll draw a number for you
-go to the very back, wait until it’s your turn, you‘ll be sent to room 6
-after the first look you‘ll be sent to room (or rather stand 2)
-there you‘ll get a stamp on your health insurance paper
-go back to room 6
-now they are going to type everything into the system, this might take up to 15min
-in the end you‘ll get a paper with your emergency case number and a paper that you‘ll need for the residence permit
You‘ll need: passport and the health insurance doc fron your home country, it’s enough if you have the student certificate on your phone

[05.10.22, 02:41:49] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: I went to the tax office, and they told me to get the number online. It worked in the end, but it was a bit difficult.
You're not allowed to use ö, ä and ü (replace with o, a and u) and you have to be careful about the two different "i" sounds in Turkish
[05.10.22, 02:43:31] ‪+49 162 9221495‬: But you need to pay 160 lira so you have to go to the office. You need to hand in the receipt
[05.10.22, 02:44:40] ‪+49 160 99596260‬: Yes, but there are two different departments for making the payment and getting the tax number. At the department for the number they are super lazy, so just get the number beforehand

Our apartment is 10mins away from Levent metro station so the transportation is quite easy to most of the places since there are bus stations and metro. We have three bedrooms and a living room. Our flat is dubleks and we want to rent the loft which is separated from rest of the flat. There is a bedroom and a bathroom there. We also live with two cats and we are smokers so we're looking for someone who is okay with that.

You can do things like join them for a BBQ on their terrace, sit and chat with them over çay while you learn how make marble art, or learn to cook a Turkish meal. I spent a lot of time with them when I first got to Istanbul and had the best experience.

[18.10.22, 11:45:04] ‪+49 1577 1309288‬: Merhaba : ) 
I am Lila, 24, currently working on my master’s thesis in anthropology and critical urban studies and trying to get acquainted to Istanbul. I arrived in July and currently live in Maçka, do an intensive Turkish class and work at ITÜ. I would love to find a place that allows me to feel at home. I am queer, love smelling the forest and am on the ongoing mission to find the best simit of the city. If you search for someone to stay in your empty room, someone to cook and eat with, to cry and joke around with then please reach out!!
I'd love to stay somewhere in Beyoğlu, Şişli, Beşiktaş or also Kadıköy (but i have to go to Taşkışla and Ayayğa often, so Europe would be better)
